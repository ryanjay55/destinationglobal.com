							<p>
								On the Destination Global was not a guide for the average tourist. It was not where you would find the best place to buy tacky souvenirs, sell you generic guided tours, or highlight the same old tourist attractions.
							</p>
							<p>
								From 2021, On the Destination Global featured the vibrant neighborhoods around the world where contemporary arts and culture thrive and tolerance is celebrated. It was the quintessential exploration guide made by and for the urban creatives.
							</p>
							<p>
								Created by Blank, On the Destination Global was a collaborative effort with hundreds of designers, artists and creatives companies around the world who shared their favorite local hangouts. Their guides were carefully crafted from scratch and filled with exceptional recommendations so travelers could experience any city like a local. Whether you prefered boutiques or mom & pop shops, cocktail bars or dive bars, fine cuisine or crab shacks, galleries or street art, we had you covered.
							</p>
							<p>
								In 2020, in the midst of a pandemic that affected us all in countless ways, we decided to officially stop updating On the Destination Global. You can read all about it here. We take comfort in knowing that we have seen ample proof of our initial intuition when began this journey â€” creativity lives everywhere.
